	 		<p class="description"> Hi! I'm Irene. I'm a third-year computer science major at UC Berkeley. 
	 			<br><br>
	 			These past two summers I've been interning at SPAWAR. This past summer, I worked on designing and building a <a href="project.html">nanosatellite emulator</a>, and the summer before, I designed and built <a href="project.html">microbial fuel cells</a>.
	 			<br><br>
	 			I'm always looking for new opportunities to improve my skills and to learn something new, so feel free to <a href="#contactBox">contact</a> me and check out my <a href="#resumeBox">resume</a> :) </p>

She's inspired a controversial song by Avril Lavigne, works of sculpture by Tom Sachs and a pretty spectacular dress worn by Lady Gaga.

I am talking about Hello Kitty, the adorable cultural force that began life as a character on a coin purse in Japan 1974. Produced by Sanrio, she arrived in the United States two years later. And she's been a part of global popular culture ever since.

This fall, she is set to take L.A. by storm, with a full-blown retrospective of Kitty art, merch and fashion at the Japanese American National Museum, which opens in mid-October. Two weeks later, the first ever Hello Kitty Con, will be held at the Museum of Contemporary Art.

Christine R. Yano is an anthropologist from the University of Hawaii (and currently a visiting professor at Harvard) who has spent years studying the phenomenon that is Hello Kitty. She is also the author of the book "Pink Globalization: Hello Kitty's Trek Across the Pacific," published by Duke University Press last year. She says that Kitty's unreadable features (she usually doesn't have a mouth), along with clever merchandising, has helped cultivate the character's following. mug has been featured on countless toys, not to mention bowling balls, motor oil, a Fender Strat, a pricey Judith Leiber clutch, sanitary napkins and men's underwear.
