Hello Kitty is not – we repeat, NOT – a cat. After 40 years of collecting the cash of cat lovers worldwide, Sanrio has revealed the secret of its star character, according to the Los Angeles Times. 

				The startling truth was uncovered by anthropologist/Hello Kitty scholar Christine R. Yano, who has studied the phenomenon surrounding the minimalist meower for years. Yano was, of course, the ideal person to help curate Los Angeles's upcoming Hello Kitty retrospective at the Japanese American National Museum. 

				After Yano waded through all the Hello Kitty toasters, coin purses and haute couture to pick out the purrfect exhibit pieces, she sent her notes to Sanrio for approval. The company was pleased with the Hello Kitty connoisseur's work, except for one earth-shattering detail. 

				"I was corrected – very firmly," Yano said. "That's one correction Sanrio made for my script for the show. Hello Kitty is not a cat. She's a cartoon character. She is a little girl. She is a friend. But she is not a cat. She's never depicted on all fours. She walks and sits like a two-legged creature. She does have a pet cat of her own, however, and it's called Charmmy Kitty."
